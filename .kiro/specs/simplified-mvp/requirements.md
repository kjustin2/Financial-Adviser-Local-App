# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a simplified MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the financial advisor application. The goal is to strip down the current complex application to just the essential core features needed for a first working version: basic user profile setup, simple financial health assessment, and basic goal setting with recommendations. This will remove unnecessary complexity, extensive testing infrastructure, and advanced features to get a clean, functional first version deployed quickly.
