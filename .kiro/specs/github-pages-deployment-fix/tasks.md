# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add missing test dependencies to package.json


  - Add `@testing-library/jest-dom` package to devDependencies
  - Add `fake-indexeddb` package to devDependencies  
  - Update package versions to compatible versions with existing setup
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_



- [x] 2. Fix ESLint configuration compatibility ✅
  - Updated `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` to version ^8.0.0
  - Resolved TypeScript version compatibility warning with ESLint packages
  - Verified ESLint execution runs without configuration errors (33 warnings, 0 errors)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_
  - **Status**: Verified - ESLint runs successfully with updated TypeScript support

- [x] 3. Update Vitest configuration for test dependencies


  - Modify `vite.config.ts` to include test setup file configuration
  - Ensure Vitest can properly resolve the new test dependencies
  - Add proper test environment configuration for DOM testing
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_



- [x] 4. Consolidate GitHub Actions workflows ✅
  - Verified the redundant `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file does not exist
  - Confirmed `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` includes all necessary quality checks
  - Workflow runs lint, test, build, and deploy in correct sequence with proper job dependencies
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
  - **Status**: Verified - Single workflow file with comprehensive quality checks and deployment

- [x] 5. Test local build process with updated dependencies ✅
  - Ran `npm install` to install new dependencies successfully
  - Executed `npm run lint` - ESLint runs without configuration errors (33 warnings, 0 errors)
  - Executed `npm test` - All 8 tests pass successfully with new test dependencies
  - Executed `npm run build` - Build completes successfully, generates optimized production bundle
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3, 3.3_
  - **Status**: Verified - All local build processes work correctly with updated dependencies

- [ ] 6. Validate workflow execution on main branch
  - Push changes to main branch to trigger GitHub Actions workflow
  - Verify all workflow steps complete successfully
  - Check that only one workflow executes instead of multiple
  - Confirm GitHub Pages deployment completes without errors
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2_
