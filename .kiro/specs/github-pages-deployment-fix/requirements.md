# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Pages deployment for the Financial Advisor web application is currently failing due to missing dependencies, ESLint configuration issues, and redundant CI/CD workflows. The system needs to be fixed to enable successful deployment with proper testing and linting checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the GitHub Pages deployment to succeed without errors, so that the web application is accessible to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main branch is pushed THEN the GitHub Pages deployment SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN all TypeScript compilation SHALL pass without errors
3. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the web application SHALL be accessible via GitHub Pages URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ESLint to run without configuration errors, so that code quality checks can be enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `npm run lint` is executed THEN ESLint SHALL find the required configuration files
2. WHEN ESLint runs THEN it SHALL use the correct TypeScript parser and plugins
3. WHEN linting completes THEN it SHALL report any code quality issues without configuration errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to run successfully, so that code quality is maintained before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `npm test` is executed THEN all test dependencies SHALL be available
2. WHEN tests run THEN the testing framework SHALL properly import required libraries
3. WHEN test execution completes THEN it SHALL provide accurate test results without import errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, efficient CI/CD workflow, so that deployment is streamlined and resource usage is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main THEN only one deployment workflow SHALL execute
2. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL include all necessary steps (lint, test, build, deploy) in the correct order
3. WHEN multiple workflows exist THEN redundant workflows SHALL be removed or consolidated
4. WHEN reviewing GitHub Actions THEN the minimal number of workflow files SHALL be maintained for the required functionality
