# Design Document

## Overview

The GitHub Pages deployment failures are caused by three main issues:
1. Missing testing dependencies (`@testing-library/jest-dom`, `fake-indexeddb`)
2. ESLint configuration referencing missing TypeScript ESLint packages
3. Redundant CI/CD workflows causing unnecessary resource usage and complexity

The solution involves fixing package dependencies, consolidating workflows, and ensuring proper configuration alignment.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis

**Workflow Redundancy:**
- Two separate workflow files (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Both workflows perform similar steps (install, lint, test, build)
- The `ci.yml` workflow has a separate deploy job that duplicates functionality
- This causes multiple parallel executions and potential conflicts

**Dependency Issues:**
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` is imported in test setup but not installed
- `fake-indexeddb` is imported but missing from dependencies
- ESLint configuration references `@typescript-eslint/recommended` but packages are installed

**Configuration Misalignment:**
- ESLint extends configuration assumes certain package versions
- Test setup imports libraries that aren't available at runtime

### Target Architecture

**Single Workflow Design:**
- Consolidate to one primary workflow file for GitHub Pages deployment
- Sequential job execution: lint → test → build → deploy
- Remove redundant workflow file to eliminate conflicts

**Dependency Resolution:**
- Add missing test dependencies to `package.json`
- Ensure all imported packages are properly installed
- Align ESLint configuration with installed packages

## Components and Interfaces

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Primary Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):**
```yaml
jobs:
  quality-checks:
    - Install dependencies
    - Run ESLint
    - Run TypeScript compilation check
    - Run test suite
  
  deploy:
    needs: quality-checks
    - Build application
    - Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

**Workflow Consolidation:**
- Keep the more comprehensive `deploy.yml` workflow
- Remove the redundant `ci.yml` workflow
- Ensure all quality checks run before deployment

### Package Dependencies

**Missing Test Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.0.0",
    "fake-indexeddb": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

**ESLint Configuration Alignment:**
- Verify `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` versions
- Ensure ESLint extends configuration matches installed packages
- Update configuration if package versions are incompatible

## Data Models

### Package.json Structure
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Runtime dependencies remain unchanged
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Add missing test dependencies
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.0.0",
    "fake-indexeddb": "^4.0.0",
    // Existing dev dependencies
  }
}
```

### Workflow Configuration
```yaml
# Single consolidated workflow
name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test-and-deploy:
    # Combined quality checks and deployment
```

## Error Handling

### Dependency Resolution Failures
- If `npm ci` fails, fallback to `npm install` (already implemented)
- Clear error messages for missing dependencies
- Fail fast on critical dependency issues

### Build Process Failures
- TypeScript compilation errors should stop the workflow
- ESLint errors should be reported but may not block deployment (configurable)
- Test failures should prevent deployment

### Deployment Failures
- Proper error reporting for GitHub Pages deployment issues
- Rollback capability through GitHub Pages interface
- Clear status reporting in GitHub Actions

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-deployment Testing
1. **Dependency Installation Test**: Verify all packages install correctly
2. **ESLint Configuration Test**: Ensure linting runs without configuration errors
3. **TypeScript Compilation Test**: Verify all TypeScript compiles successfully
4. **Unit Test Execution**: Run existing test suite with proper dependencies
5. **Build Process Test**: Ensure Vite build completes successfully

### Post-deployment Verification
1. **GitHub Pages Accessibility**: Verify deployed site loads correctly
2. **Asset Loading**: Ensure all static assets are accessible
3. **Routing Functionality**: Test client-side routing works on GitHub Pages

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep previous successful deployment available through GitHub Pages history
- Document rollback process for quick recovery
- Monitor deployment status and provide alerts for failures

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Dependency Resolution
1. Add missing test dependencies to `package.json`
2. Verify ESLint configuration compatibility
3. Test local build process with new dependencies

### Phase 2: Workflow Consolidation
1. Update the primary deployment workflow
2. Remove redundant CI workflow file
3. Test workflow execution on feature branch

### Phase 3: Validation and Deployment
1. Verify all quality checks pass
2. Test deployment to GitHub Pages
3. Validate deployed application functionality

This design ensures a streamlined, reliable deployment process while maintaining code quality standards and minimizing resource usage.
