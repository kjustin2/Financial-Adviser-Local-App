# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical TypeScript compilation errors preventing successful GitHub Pages deployment of the CLI Financial Advisor web interface. The errors include type import/export issues, missing type definitions, undefined properties, and type compatibility problems that must be resolved to enable automated deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript compilation to succeed without errors, so that the web application can be deployed to GitHub Pages automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN it SHALL complete without any type errors
2. WHEN `npx tsc --noEmit` is executed THEN it SHALL return exit code 0
3. WHEN type imports are used THEN they SHALL be properly distinguished from value imports
4. IF enum or type values are needed at runtime THEN they SHALL be imported as values, not types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type safety and IntelliSense support, so that I can develop with confidence and catch errors early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with enums and types THEN they SHALL be properly defined and accessible
2. WHEN using optional properties THEN they SHALL be properly handled with null checks
3. WHEN working with form data THEN type safety SHALL be maintained throughout the component lifecycle
4. IF properties are potentially undefined THEN proper type guards SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type definitions across the application, so that components can interact reliably without type conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN types are shared between components THEN they SHALL be consistently defined and exported
2. WHEN enum values are compared THEN they SHALL use proper type-safe comparisons
3. WHEN date inputs are handled THEN they SHALL have consistent type handling
4. IF test files are included THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions for testing frameworks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused imports and variables to be cleaned up, so that the codebase remains maintainable and compilation is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are declared THEN only used imports SHALL remain in the code
2. WHEN variables are declared THEN unused variables SHALL be removed or marked as intentionally unused
3. WHEN functions have parameters THEN unused parameters SHALL be prefixed with underscore or removed
4. IF code is temporarily unused THEN it SHALL be properly commented or removed
