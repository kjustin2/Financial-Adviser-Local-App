# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CLI Financial Advisor application currently has incomplete test coverage and several failing tests. This feature aims to establish comprehensive testing coverage across all application components, fix existing test failures, and implement a robust testing infrastructure that ensures all features work correctly and remain stable over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing tests to pass, so that I can trust the current test suite and build upon it confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without errors
2. WHEN tests encounter type mismatches THEN the code SHALL handle Decimal and float operations correctly
3. WHEN testing model properties THEN default values SHALL be properly initialized
4. WHEN testing analytics calculations THEN the logic SHALL produce expected results consistently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all CLI commands, so that user-facing functionality is thoroughly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing setup commands THEN all profile creation and initialization flows SHALL be covered
2. WHEN testing profile commands THEN all profile management operations SHALL be tested
3. WHEN testing portfolio commands THEN all holding management operations SHALL be covered
4. WHEN testing goals commands THEN all goal management operations SHALL be tested
5. WHEN testing analysis commands THEN all analytics and recommendation features SHALL be tested
6. WHEN testing reports commands THEN all report generation and data export features SHALL be covered
7. WHEN testing learn commands THEN all educational content delivery SHALL be validated
8. WHEN testing utils commands THEN all utility and system management features SHALL be tested

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all core business logic, so that the application's financial calculations and data handling are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing storage operations THEN all database CRUD operations SHALL be covered
2. WHEN testing encryption functionality THEN all data security operations SHALL be validated
3. WHEN testing analytics calculations THEN all portfolio analysis features SHALL be thoroughly tested
4. WHEN testing recommendation engine THEN all recommendation generation logic SHALL be covered
5. WHEN testing data models THEN all validation and business rules SHALL be tested

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that validate end-to-end workflows, so that complete user journeys work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing user onboarding THEN the complete setup-to-first-analysis workflow SHALL be validated
2. WHEN testing portfolio management THEN the add-holding-to-analysis workflow SHALL be covered
3. WHEN testing goal tracking THEN the create-goal-to-progress-tracking workflow SHALL be tested
4. WHEN testing data persistence THEN backup and restore workflows SHALL be validated
5. WHEN testing CLI interactions THEN menu navigation and command execution SHALL be tested

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test infrastructure improvements, so that tests are maintainable, fast, and provide clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for the full suite
2. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate the problem and location
3. WHEN adding new tests THEN fixtures and utilities SHALL be available to reduce boilerplate
4. WHEN running tests THEN test data SHALL be isolated and not affect other tests
5. WHEN measuring coverage THEN the target SHALL be at least 90% line coverage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated test quality checks, so that test code maintains high standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
2. WHEN creating test data THEN realistic sample data SHALL be used
3. WHEN testing edge cases THEN boundary conditions and error scenarios SHALL be covered
4. WHEN testing async operations THEN proper async test patterns SHALL be used
5. WHEN testing CLI interactions THEN both success and error paths SHALL be validated

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and security testing, so that the application meets non-functional requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing with large datasets THEN performance SHALL remain acceptable
2. WHEN testing encryption operations THEN security properties SHALL be validated
3. WHEN testing data storage THEN data integrity SHALL be ensured
4. WHEN testing file operations THEN proper error handling SHALL be verified
5. WHEN testing memory usage THEN no significant memory leaks SHALL occur
