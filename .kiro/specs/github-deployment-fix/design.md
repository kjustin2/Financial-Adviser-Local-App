# Design Document

## Overview

The GitHub Actions deployment failure is caused by a misconfigured Node.js caching setup. The workflow attempts to cache npm dependencies using `package-lock.json` as the cache dependency path, but this file doesn't exist in the repository. This creates a path resolution error that prevents the cache action from working properly.

The solution involves fixing the caching configuration to work with the actual project structure and implementing robust fallback mechanisms to ensure deployment reliability.

## Architecture

### Current Problem Analysis

1. **Missing Lock File**: The workflow references `./web/package-lock.json` which doesn't exist
2. **Cache Path Resolution**: The `actions/setup-node@v4` cache action fails when the specified dependency path cannot be resolved
3. **No Fallback**: The workflow has no graceful degradation when caching fails

### Solution Architecture

The fix will implement a multi-layered approach:

1. **Primary Solution**: Fix the cache configuration to work with existing project structure
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Implement cache-less operation when cache setup fails
3. **Lock File Management**: Generate and maintain proper lock files for consistent dependency resolution

## Components and Interfaces

### GitHub Actions Workflow Components

#### Node.js Setup Configuration
- **Input**: Node.js version, cache type, cache dependency path
- **Output**: Configured Node.js environment with optional caching
- **Responsibility**: Set up Node.js runtime with optimized dependency caching

#### Cache Strategy Options
1. **Option A**: Use `package.json` as cache key (less optimal but functional)
2. **Option B**: Generate `package-lock.json` and use it for caching
3. **Option C**: Disable caching temporarily and rely on fresh installs

#### Fallback Mechanism
- **Trigger**: Cache setup failure or path resolution error
- **Action**: Continue workflow without caching
- **Logging**: Record cache failure for debugging

### Workflow Structure

```yaml
# Simplified structure showing key components
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup-node (with fixed caching)
      - install-dependencies
      - run-tests
  
  build-and-deploy:
    steps:
      - checkout  
      - setup-node (with fixed caching)
      - install-dependencies
      - build
      - deploy
```

## Data Models

### Cache Configuration Model
```yaml
cache_config:
  type: string           # 'npm', 'yarn', or disabled
  dependency_path: string # Path to lock file or package.json
  fallback_enabled: boolean
```

### Workflow State Model
```yaml
workflow_state:
  cache_status: enum     # 'enabled', 'disabled', 'failed'
  node_version: string
  working_directory: string
  dependency_manager: string
```

## Error Handling

### Cache Resolution Failures
- **Detection**: Monitor setup-node action output for cache errors
- **Response**: Log warning and continue without cache
- **Recovery**: Ensure npm install works regardless of cache state

### Path Resolution Issues
- **Prevention**: Validate cache dependency paths exist before workflow execution
- **Mitigation**: Use fallback cache strategies (package.json instead of lock file)
- **Logging**: Provide clear error messages for debugging

### Dependency Installation Failures
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanism for npm ci/install commands
- **Alternative Commands**: Fall back from `npm ci` to `npm install` if lock file issues persist
- **Clean State**: Clear node_modules and cache on retry attempts

## Testing Strategy

### Workflow Testing Approach
1. **Local Validation**: Test workflow changes in fork/branch before main deployment
2. **Matrix Testing**: Test with different Node.js versions and cache configurations
3. **Failure Simulation**: Intentionally break cache to test fallback mechanisms

### Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Cache**: Verify caching works with proper configuration
2. **Cache Miss**: Ensure workflow succeeds when cache is unavailable
3. **Path Resolution Error**: Test fallback when dependency path is invalid
4. **Lock File Generation**: Verify lock file creation and usage

### Validation Criteria
- Workflow completes successfully with and without cache
- Build artifacts are generated correctly
- Deployment to GitHub Pages succeeds
- Error messages are clear and actionable

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Generate Lock File (Recommended)
- Generate `package-lock.json` during workflow execution
- Use generated lock file for caching
- Commit lock file to repository for consistency

### Option 2: Use Package.json for Caching
- Change cache dependency path to `./web/package.json`
- Less optimal caching but functional
- No additional file generation required

### Option 3: Disable Caching Temporarily
- Remove cache configuration entirely
- Rely on fresh npm installs
- Simplest fix but slower builds

## Security Considerations

- Ensure generated lock files don't introduce security vulnerabilities
- Validate that cache mechanisms don't expose sensitive information
- Maintain principle of least privilege in workflow permissions

## Performance Impact

- **With Proper Caching**: Significant build time reduction (30-60% faster)
- **Without Caching**: Longer build times but reliable execution
- **Lock File Generation**: Minimal overhead during workflow execution
