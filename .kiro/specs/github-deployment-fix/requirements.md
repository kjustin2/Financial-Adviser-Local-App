# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the GitHub Actions deployment failure related to Node.js caching issues. The deployment is failing because the cache action cannot resolve specified paths for npm dependencies, preventing successful CI/CD pipeline execution. This fix will ensure reliable deployment workflows for the CLI Financial Advisor project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions deployments to succeed consistently, so that I can deploy updates to the CLI Financial Advisor without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GitHub Actions workflow runs THEN the Node.js setup SHALL complete successfully without cache resolution errors
2. WHEN npm dependencies are cached THEN the cache paths SHALL be correctly resolved and accessible
3. WHEN the deployment workflow executes THEN it SHALL complete without "unable to cache dependencies" errors
4. IF cache resolution fails THEN the workflow SHALL fallback gracefully without breaking the deployment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to be robust and maintainable, so that future deployments remain reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub Actions workflow is configured THEN it SHALL use current best practices for Node.js setup and caching
2. WHEN cache configuration is applied THEN it SHALL be compatible with the project's package manager and structure
3. WHEN the workflow runs on different environments THEN it SHALL handle path resolution consistently
4. IF npm cache directory changes THEN the workflow SHALL adapt automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and logging in the deployment process, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix future issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache operations fail THEN the workflow SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN path resolution issues occur THEN the workflow SHALL provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN the deployment succeeds THEN it SHALL confirm successful cache operations
4. IF debugging is needed THEN the workflow SHALL provide sufficient logging detail
