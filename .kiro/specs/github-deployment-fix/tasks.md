# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix Node.js caching configuration in GitHub Actions workflow


  - Update the cache dependency path in both test and build-and-deploy jobs
  - Change from non-existent `package-lock.json` to existing `package.json`
  - Add fallback mechanism for cache failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Generate and commit package-lock.json for optimal caching


  - Create package-lock.json file in the web directory using npm install
  - Update workflow to use the new lock file for caching
  - Ensure lock file is committed to repository for consistency
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Implement robust error handling in workflow


  - Add conditional steps that handle cache setup failures gracefully
  - Implement retry logic for dependency installation commands
  - Add detailed logging for debugging cache and installation issues
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Add workflow validation and testing steps


  - Create a test script to validate workflow configuration locally
  - Add workflow dispatch trigger for manual testing
  - Implement matrix testing for different Node.js versions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Update workflow with improved dependency installation strategy



  - Replace npm ci with more robust installation commands
  - Add clean installation fallback when lock file issues occur
  - Implement cache warming strategy for faster subsequent builds
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 2.4_
