# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive Playwright end-to-end testing to the Financial Advisor Web Application to ensure all core features work correctly from a user perspective. The testing suite will validate the complete user journey through portfolio management, goal tracking, risk assessment, and recommendations while maintaining the privacy-first, local-only architecture. All tests must run locally without external dependencies and provide detailed feedback on feature functionality.
