# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the CLI Financial Advisor application into a client-side web application that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. The application will use IndexedDB for local data storage, maintaining privacy while providing a clean web-based user experience with all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to access the financial advisor through a web browser without any installation, so that I can use the application immediately on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the GitHub Pages URL THEN the system SHALL load the web application without requiring any installation
2. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL work in modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. WHEN a user uses the application THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the current CLI version
4. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL persist their data locally using IndexedDB
5. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL not require user login or authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build processes for creating the web application, so that I can efficiently deploy to GitHub Pages with optimized assets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process is triggered THEN the system SHALL create optimized static web assets
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL bundle all JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files
3. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL optimize file sizes for fast web loading
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL provide files ready for GitHub Pages deployment
5. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL validate that all web functionality works correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all web application functionality, so that I can ensure the client-side application works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage across all modules
2. WHEN testing web UI components THEN the system SHALL validate all user interface elements work correctly
3. WHEN testing IndexedDB operations THEN the system SHALL verify local data storage functions properly
4. WHEN testing data encryption THEN the system SHALL confirm client-side encryption features work as expected
5. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL validate all forms and input handling work correctly
6. WHEN testing portfolio calculations THEN the system SHALL verify all financial calculations are accurate in the browser
7. WHEN testing recommendations THEN the system SHALL confirm the recommendation engine produces valid output in the web environment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive web interface, so that I can easily manage my financial data without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
2. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL offer intuitive menus and clear visual hierarchy
3. WHEN entering data THEN the system SHALL provide helpful form validation and user feedback
4. WHEN viewing financial information THEN the system SHALL display data in clear charts, tables, and summaries
5. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and confirmation messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and deployment processes for the web application, so that I can ensure quality and streamline GitHub Pages deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL automatically run the full test suite
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages
3. WHEN testing the build THEN the system SHALL verify all web functionality works in the production environment
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL validate that the live site loads and functions correctly
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide clear error feedback
