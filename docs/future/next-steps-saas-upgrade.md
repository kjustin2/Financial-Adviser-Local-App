## Phase 2: Cloud Infrastructure Preparation (6-12 weeks)

### Database Migration Strategy
```python
# Current: SQLite (Local)
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./database/financial_adviser.db"

# Target: PostgreSQL (Multi-tenant SaaS)
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/financial_adviser"
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Schema Adaptation**: Add tenant isolation columns
2. **Multi-tenancy**: Implement row-level security
3. **Data Migration**: Tools for SQLite → PostgreSQL conversion
4. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize for concurrent users

### API Scaling Enhancements
```python
# Add tenant context to all models
class BaseModel:
    tenant_id = Column(UUID, nullable=False, index=True)
    
# Implement tenant middleware
@app.middleware("http")
async def tenant_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    # Extract tenant from subdomain or JWT
    tenant_id = get_tenant_from_request(request)
    request.state.tenant_id = tenant_id
```

### Cloud-Native Architecture
- **Containerization**: Docker + Kubernetes deployment
- **Load Balancing**: Multi-instance API serving
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management and data caching
- **Background Jobs**: Celery for market data processing
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible storage for reports and uploads

## Phase 3: SaaS Core Features (3-6 months)

### User Management & Billing
- [ ] **Multi-tenant Authentication**: Auth0 or custom OAuth2 implementation
- [ ] **Subscription Management**: Stripe integration for billing
- [ ] **User Roles**: Admin, advisor, client role-based access
- [ ] **Team Management**: Multi-user workspace support

### Enhanced Security
```python
# Tenant data isolation
@app.middleware("http") 
async def tenant_isolation_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    # Ensure all queries are tenant-scoped
    current_tenant = get_current_tenant(request)
    with tenant_context(current_tenant):
        response = await call_next(request)
    return response
```

## Technical Migration Strategy

### 1. Database Evolution
```sql
-- Phase 1: Add tenant columns to existing tables
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID;
ALTER TABLE portfolios ADD COLUMN tenant_id UUID;

-- Phase 2: Implement row-level security
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON users 
FOR ALL TO application_role 
USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::UUID);
```

### 2. API Versioning Strategy
```python
# Maintain backward compatibility
app.include_router(v1_router, prefix="/api/v1")  # Local app compatibility
app.include_router(v2_router, prefix="/api/v2")  # SaaS enhancements
```

### 3. Configuration Management
```python
# Environment-based configuration
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    deployment_mode: str = "local"  # local, saas, enterprise
    database_url: str
    redis_url: Optional[str] = None
    stripe_api_key: Optional[str] = None
    auth0_domain: Optional[str] = None
```

## Business Considerations
