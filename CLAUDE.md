## Code Patterns and Implementation

### Backend Architecture Patterns

#### Layered Architecture
The backend follows a clean layered architecture:
- **Models Layer**: SQLAlchemy ORM models with business logic properties
- **Schemas Layer**: Pydantic models for API validation and serialization
- **API Layer**: FastAPI routes with dependency injection
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and complex operations
- **Security Layer**: JWT authentication and AES-256 encryption

#### Key Patterns Implemented
- **Dependency Injection**: Centralized authentication and database dependencies
- **Repository Pattern**: SQLAlchemy models with computed properties
- **Security Patterns**: JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, encrypted configuration
- **Error Handling**: Global exception handlers with standardized error responses

#### Database Patterns
- **Base Model**: Common fields (id, created_at, updated_at, is_active) for all entities
- **Soft Deletion**: Using is_active flags instead of hard deletes
- **Relationship Management**: Proper foreign keys with cascade operations
- **Computed Properties**: Business calculations as model properties

### Frontend Architecture Patterns

#### Component-Based Architecture
The frontend uses a structured component hierarchy:
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui primitives for consistent design
- **Layout Components**: Header, Sidebar, Layout for application structure
- **Page Components**: Feature-specific pages with business logic
- **Hook Pattern**: Custom hooks for API calls and state management

#### Key Patterns Implemented
- **Service Layer**: Centralized API calls with error handling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with shared types
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form with Zod validation

### Security Implementation

#### Local-First Security
- **Encrypted Storage**: API keys encrypted with AES-256 using Fernet
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with secure token handling
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Pydantic validation on all API inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Restricted origins for cross-origin requests

#### Data Protection
- **Local Database**: SQLite for development, easily migrated to PostgreSQL
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: All financial data stays on user's machine
- **Secure Defaults**: HTTPS enforcement, secure headers, input sanitization

### Development Workflow Patterns

#### Code Quality
- **Backend**: Black (formatting), isort (imports), ruff (linting), mypy (type checking)
- **Frontend**: ESLint (linting), Prettier (formatting), TypeScript (type checking)
- **Testing**: pytest (backend), Vitest (frontend) with comprehensive fixtures

#### File Organization
- **Backend**: Clear separation of models, schemas, API routes, and services
- **Frontend**: Component hierarchy with hooks, services, and type definitions
- **Documentation**: Organized in docs/mvp/ and docs/future/ folders

### Performance Considerations

#### Backend Optimization
- **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy session management
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient loading of related data
- **Query Optimization**: Eager loading to prevent N+1 queries

#### Frontend Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Vite's automatic bundle optimization
- **Memoization**: React.memo for expensive components
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Proper state management with React Query
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time optimization with TypeScript

### Testing Strategy (Implemented Best Practices)

#### Backend Testing (Current Implementation)
- **Unit Tests**: Individual model and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with test database
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data and database sessions  
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage with pytest-cov
- **Test Isolation**: Each test uses fresh database state
- **Error Testing**: Comprehensive validation error testing
- **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization testing

#### Testing Best Practices (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Always run these after ANY code change:
poetry run pytest tests/test_api/test_auth.py -v  # Core functionality
poetry run pytest --tb=short                     # Quick overview

# For debugging specific issues:
poetry run pytest tests/test_api/test_auth.py::TestClass::test_method -v -s

# Before committing changes:
poetry run pytest --cov=app                      # Full coverage report
```

#### Test Debugging Strategy
When tests fail:
1. **Isolate the Issue**: Run only the failing test with `-v -s` flags
2. **Create Debug Scripts**: Write standalone scripts to reproduce issues
3. **Check Test Fixtures**: Ensure fixtures are properly set up and torn down
4. **Validate Data Flow**: Verify database state, session management, and data persistence
5. **Review Logs**: Use logging output to trace execution flow

#### Frontend Testing
- **Component Tests**: Individual component testing with React Testing Library
- **Hook Tests**: Custom hook testing with proper mocking
- **Integration Tests**: Page-level testing with API mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow testing with Playwright (126 comprehensive tests)

#### Playwright E2E Testing (MANDATORY)
**CRITICAL**: All Playwright tests MUST pass after any code changes. The test suite includes 126 comprehensive tests across 4 test suites covering:

- **Authentication Flow**: Login/register page validation and error handling
- **Dashboard Navigation**: User interface interactions and routing  
- **Portfolio Management**: Investment tracking and portfolio operations
- **Settings & Profile**: User profile management and configuration

**Running Playwright Tests**:
```bash
npm run test:e2e              # Run all E2E tests (must pass)
npm run test:e2e:ui           # Run with interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:debug        # Run in debug mode for troubleshooting
```

**Test Requirements**:
- All 126 tests must pass before committing any changes
- Tests validate both UI interactions and API integrations
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Client-side validation and error message display
- Authentication flows and protected route access

### Logging Best Practices (Implemented)

#### Structured Logging Implementation
- **Request Tracking**: Every API request logged with IP, method, endpoint
- **User Actions**: Authentication attempts, registration, profile changes
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logging with stack traces and context
- **Performance Monitoring**: Request timing and response status codes
- **Security Events**: Failed login attempts, invalid tokens, suspicious activity

#### Logging Levels and Usage
```python
# Request/Response logging (INFO level)
logger.info(f"Registration attempt for email: {user_data.email}",
    extra={"client_ip": client_ip, "email": user_data.email})

# Warning for business logic issues (WARNING level) 
logger.warning(f"Registration failed - email already exists: {email}",
    extra={"client_ip": client_ip, "email": email})

# Errors with full context (ERROR level)
logger.error(f"Unexpected error during registration: {email}",
    extra={"client_ip": client_ip, "error": error_details})
```

#### Log File Organization
- **Application Logs**: `database/logs/app_YYYYMMDD.log`
- **Error Logs**: `database/logs/errors_YYYYMMDD.log`
- **Daily Rotation**: Automatic log file rotation for disk space management
- **Structured Data**: JSON-style extra fields for easy parsing and analysis

#### Debugging with Logs
1. **Follow Request Flow**: Track requests from entry to completion
2. **Context Preservation**: Include relevant data (user_id, email, etc.) in all related log entries
3. **Error Correlation**: Link errors to specific user actions and requests
4. **Performance Analysis**: Use timing data to identify bottlenecks
